      "Heat a large, high-sided, skillet until hot on medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil - it should run easily but not sizzle or burn. Add 1 pound of raw shrimp (peeled, deveined, tails off) without overcrowding. You might have to cook it in 2 batches. Sprinkle shrimp with seasonings to taste (Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper).",
      "Cook shrimp, flipping it once or twice, on medium heat, about 3-4 minutes total, until pink in color. Do not overcook.",

      "Watch the nuts at all times as they burn really quickly.",
      "**Seafood.** This recipe works great with shrimp, scallops, cooked lobster meat, and lump crab meat.",
      "**Greens.** I used arugula which adds a nice, peppery flavor. You can also add baby spinach, mixed greens, or butter lettuce.",
      "**Onions.** I used red onions. Finely chopped green onions work, too.",
      "**Fruit.** You have so many choices here. My personal preference is any type of orange color fruit because it adds such a nice vibrance to this shrimp avocado salad. I recommend mango, peaches, nectarines, and apricots. You can also add citrus fruit which will pair well with shrimp, such as oranges, mandarine oranges, or grapefruit.",
      "**Salad dressing.** The simple salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). You can also use maple syrup and lemon juice.",
      "**Use pre-cooked shrimp.** It saves so much time, and this avocado salad is just a great way to dress up the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp.",
      "**Any size of shrimp works.** I do prefer to use large, but this is a great recipe to use up smaller cooked shrimp!",
      "**Cook shrimp from scratch.** If you have raw shrimp, simply cook it on the stovetop. Here is a nice, light recipe for [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/).",
      "**Freshly squeezed lime juice** is a must! It's so much better than the bottled kind!",
      "**Note about mango.** The mango should be ripe but not overly ripe and mushy. When buying mango it should have a little give when you press the skin gently. It should not be overly soft. The color should be orange or yellow for at least one-fourth of the fruit's skin. Always peel mangoes.",
      "**A ripe avocado** should have a little give when gently pressed. It should not be overly soft - nobody likes over-ripe avocados that turn into mush.",
      "**An unripe avocado** will have no give and will feel almost like a rock when lightly pressed. It will be really hard to cut it and remove the pit.",
      "If making ahead, don't slice the avocado until ready to serve as it will brown.",
      "Also, add salad dressing last moment to keep everything fresh and not wilted.",
      "The shrimp avocado salad can be refrigerated for 2 days. It's best to refrigerate the salad and the dressing separately.",

      "**_Sugar_** – This might seem odd, but the sugar makes for a tastier dough, plus, it gives the yeast something to feed on which promotes proofing or rising.",
      "**_Flour_** – I only ever used all-purpose unbleached flour in my dough. I have not experimented with other flour options at this point.",
      "**_Warm Water_** – The water should be as close to 110 degrees F as possible. Too hot and you will kill the yeast; too cold and it won’t activate properly.",

      "**_Sun Dried Tomatoes_** – Use the ones packed in oil. They have better flavour.",

Place the dough back into the metal mixing bowl, cover it with a tea towel, and set the bowl on top of your preheating oven. (Don't place the bowl on a burner, just on the surface of the oven. The heat will help the dough to proof/rise.) Let the dough sit for five minutes.",
      "Lightly spray two small baking sheets or pizza pans with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.",
      "When the dough is ready, lightly flour a flat surface, and using a floured rolling pin, roll half of the dough into a rectangular shape about the size of your pan.  Place the dough onto the baking sheet and push the dough into the corners and up to the sides. This does not need to be perfectly round or rectangular. Just be sure the dough is evenly flattened. (Repeat with the other half of the dough on a second baking sheet or pizza pan.)",

      "Evenly distribute the mozzarella over the two flatbreads. Avoid placing cheese on the egg-washed perimeter.",

      "Because of the slow cooking process and the number of other flavours added to the beef, there isn’t a lot of benefit in buying an expensive cut of meat. This is a good recipe to save money on a cheap cut of meat, which will become tender and flavourful as it cooks.",
      "The red wine is an amazing source of flavour for a ragu and I always keep a bottle on hand to use in recipes like this. If you don’t want to cook with wine, it can be replaced with beef stock.",
      "Barley is optional, but is a great way to thicken the ragu while adding nutrition. Barley doesn’t add a lot of flavour beyond a subtle nuttiness, but makes the ragu creamier by releasing starch during the cooking process.",
      "A hearty pasta sauce needs a hearty pasta, so choose a thick pasta like pappardelle, fettuccine or tagliatelle.",
      "1.5-2 kg /3-4lbs beef roast the cheapest cut will do",
      "2 tbsp olive oil",
      "2-3 sprigs handful each fresh rosemary and fresh thyme stems discarded and leaves finely chopped",

      "Cut roast into 2″-3″ cubes and brown them in olive oil in a frying pan over high heat in stages, don’t overcrowd the meat so it browns nicely. Add it to the vegetables.",
      "Taking the frying pan off the heat, pour wine into the pan and use wooden spoon to loosen all the delicious bits from the bottom of the pan, that's where much of the flavour is concentrated. Pour the wine into the crock pot along with canned tomatoes.",

      "In the last hour take the lid off and shred the beef with two forks, add one more tablespoon of fresh rosemary and thyme and a splash of water or wine if the meat is too dry. Cook for one hour longer.",
      "At the end of cooking time stir in butter for more flavour and to add a gloss to your ragu.",
      "Before serving cook your pasta in a large pot of salted water according to package directions. Combine ⅓ of beef ragu with hot pasta and sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan cheese."

      "**It is so easy:** Marinate the chicken the night before. Then sauté the chicken and toss it in the pot with the rest of the ingredients before enjoying your day. Then, you can come back to a delicious but easy meal.",
      "**Authentic flavor:** If your goal is to serve an authentic Indian meal, this one you should definitely try.",
      "**Leftovers taste incredible:** Some recipes taste better the next day. This crockpot butter chicken is one of them. Save some for lunch or dinner tomorrow.",
      "**Make it your way:** Although I prefer this dish just the way it is, sometimes I like to mix it up by adding or removing some of the ingredients. For example, when I have people sensitive to spicy foods, I leave out chili powder and garam masala.",
      "**Slow cooker** – Whether you have a slow cooker or crockpot, the directions are the same.",
      "**Large skillet** – For sautéing the chicken.",
      "**Wooden spoon –** I prefer wooden utensils because they do not scratch the ceramic in my slow cooker.",
      "**Chicken –** I use skinless boneless chicken thighs because they are easy to prepare, and my family prefers white meat. Whatever meat you use, just cut it into two-inch cubes.",
      "**Yogurt**—Plain Greek yogurt is my preference for this marinade. It adds a nice, mellow acid with a mild, creamy flavor.",
      "**Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.",
      "**Garlic powder**—I put garlic powder in just about everything, and it is perfect for marinating chicken because it is concentrated and will add more garlic taste.",
      "**Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.",
      "**Turmeric –** A popular curry spice, turmeric adds an earthy background with hints of pepper, ginger, and sweetness. Some say it tastes similar to mustard. It can also be somewhat bitter if you use too much.",
      "**Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.",
      "**Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red chili powder and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.",
      "**Paprika –** Gives your marinade a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.",
      "**Salt**—I prefer to use sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.",
      "**Olive oil –** I always use extra virgin olive oil because it is light and has a mild flavor**.** In this recipe, it is used to sauté the chicken.",
      "**Butter**—Because butter is the star of this dish, I only use the highest-quality butter without salt. If your butter has salt, remove it from the sauce ingredients.",
      "**Onion –** Minced and sauteed to add a fresh onion flavor without any bitterness that the powder has.",
      "**Garlic –** Also minced and sauteed, fresh garlic gives your sauce a deep, rich garlic taste.",
      "**Tomato sauce**—Another important ingredient. I prefer to use organic tomatoes to make my own, but you can use your favorite brand.",
      "**Evaporated milk –** Any kind of evaporated milk will do, but the better the quality, the better the flavor.",
      "**Heavy cream**—Do not substitute this ingredient unless you really have to because it gives your sauce the creaminess it needs to taste authentic.",
      "**Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.",
      "**Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.",
      "**Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.",
      "**Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.",
      "**Paprika –** Gives your sauce a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.",
      "**Salt**—I prefer sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.",
      "**Black pepper –** Grind your own from fresh peppercorns for the best taste.",
      "**Sugar –** I use granulated white sugar for sweetness, but you could use honey or maple syrup.",
      "**Different cuts:** Instead of skinless boneless chicken breast, you could also use thighs. Dark meat has a more robust flavor and is always juicy.",
      "**Different meat:** If your butcher does not have fresh organic chicken, you could use a different meat. I have tried pork, turkey. They are all truly delicious in their way.",
      "**Cheesy butter chicken:** Another way to change this recipe is to add some shredded cheese. I have tried cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan.",
      "**Make it spicy:** Even with the garam masala and chili powder, this dish is not that spicy. If you want to add some heat, add red pepper flakes to the marinade and toss chopped jalapenos into the sauce.",
      "To make this a whole meal in one pot, add some baby red potatoes, celery, carrots, and cauliflower.",
      "I like to serve my saucy butter chicken on top of some [perfect fluffy rice](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/how-to-cook-perfect-rice-in-the-instant-pot/) and garlic naan on the side.",
      "Any kind of side dish would pair nicely with this dish, but for an Indian theme, try it with chutney, chana masala, naan, or [grilled eggplant](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-eggplant-recipe/).",
      "Add a light salad on the side, like this [strawberry broccoli salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/strawberry-broccoli-salad-recipe/) or [grilled zucchini salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-zucchini-salad-recipe/).",
      "To help soak that delicious sauce, serve with some crusty French bread or rolls like my [Amish potato dinner rolls](https://urls.grow.me/https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/amish-potato-dinner-rolls-recipe/%23growSource=search&growReferrer=true).",
      "**Refrigerate:** After cooled to room temperature, put your crockpot butter chicken in a sealed container. It will stay fresh for up to 10 days.",
      "**Freezing:** If you want to keep it longer, you must freeze it. Once it has cooled, pour it into a freezer-safe container or freezer bag, and it can stay frozen for four to six months.",
      "**Defrost:** Remove your frozen leftovers from the freezer and put them in the fridge the night before you plan to serve them.",
      "**Reheating:** Heat in a saucepan on the stove for 10 minutes or in the microwave for one or two minutes.",
      "To easily remove cardamom pods after cooking, use a needle and thread to tie them together. Then, before serving, lift the thread out to remove all the pods at once.",
      "If your chicken is too thin, add some cornstarch slurry and heat it a little longer. You can make a slurry by mixing one tablespoon of cornstarch with one cup of warm water.",
      "If it has an acid taste, add another tablespoon of sugar or honey.",
      "I usually double the sauce recipe because I like to use it when reheating. It also tastes great on tacos, pasta, and bread.",
      "When freezing, put your leftovers in small freezer-safe containers to take out just what you need when you need it.",

      "**Let them grill undisturbed** to get more defined grill marks. Check after 2-3 minutes and flip when ready.",
      "**Use a thin spatula:** It’s best to use a thin spatula to lift the peaches from underneath. Using tongs to flip peaches on the grill can sometimes rip the grill marks apart.",
      "**Outdoor grill, stovetop grill pan, or indoor electric grill:** I prefer cast iron, but if you’re worried about the fruit sticking to the grill, you can use a nonstick.",
      "**Fresh peaches:** They should be ripe but firm. They need to be ripe for their natural sweetness to come out, but also relatively firm so that they don’t fall apart on the grill. The larger the peaches, the better.",
      "**Olive oil:** Brushing the peaches with olive oil helps prevent sticking.",

Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side or until lightly charred (or grilled to your liking). Remove to a plate to allow to slightly cool before dicing.",

Grill the chicken, turning halfway through grilling, about 4-6 minutes per side (until the thickest part of the chicken registers 165 degrees F and juices run clear). Baste the chicken with the reserved marinade as you grill and after flipping. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil, so the juices can re-distribute. Slice thinly or chop into bite-sized pieces.",
      "While the chicken cooks, prepare the salsa. Dice the pineapple, cilantro, jalapeno, and red onion. Toss everything together in a large bowl with the freshly squeezed lime juice, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. I add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, but add to preference. Gently toss together, taste, and then adjust seasoning if needed. Serve spooned generously over the grilled chicken.",

Check out my how to cook and dice a pumpkin tutorial [here](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/how-to-cook-a-pumpkin-homemade-pumpkin-puree/).",

      "**Lots of veggies:** Not only does this recipe involve pumpkin, but also cauliflower, carrots, red bell pepper, green onion and peas. So yes, it’s time to #eatyourveggies.",
      "**Light coconut milk:** I like using a [light canned coconut milk](https://amzn.to/3j5RYmA) in this dish because it’s not as rich as regular full fat coconut milk. There’s still a lot of coconut flavor though.",
      "**Vegetarian broth:** a little bit of [vegetable broth](https://amzn.to/3mPmvY9) adds the right amount of liquid to this curry recipe.",
      "**Soy sauce:** I recommend a low sodium [soy sauce](https://amzn.to/364GTyv) and be sure it’s gluten free if you want to keep this recipe gluten free. You can also use coconut aminos.",
      "**Peanut butter:** To bring the dish together, you must add a little [peanut butter](https://amzn.to/3kJ82er). It gives the recipe a unique umami flavor that helps to bring everything together. If you’re not into peanut butter, try cashew butter or even tahini.",
      "**The anti-inflammatory trio:** aka fresh garlic, ginger and [turmeric](https://amzn.to/33RpzKE). Not only do these three bring flavor to the dish but also help to boost your immune system with health benefits. Ginger is great for your digestive system, garlic helps fight bacteria, and turmeric provides an anti-inflammatory boost. I’m in loveeeee.",
      "**Cozy spices:** you’ll also be using [yellow curry powder](https://amzn.to/366ByqC) and a pinch of [cayenne pepper](https://amzn.to/2RVYwIv). I like to use curry powder instead of yellow curry paste for ease.",

I would not recommend freezing the pumpkin curry with rice. To reheat it, simply thaw the chickpea pumpkin curry in the refrigerator.

      "After that hour has passed and you are ready to make your pumpkin ravioli, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. Add in the parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.",
      "On your countertop or a large cutting board, unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. Throw some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out and then using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.",
      "At this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray. Gently move your dough to lighly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well. Gently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells. Then roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. Take your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli. Using your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame and lightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed. Lift your tray and carefully turn upsidedown on a parchement paper lined baking tray. The ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. Collect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.",
      "Add your fresh ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. While your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat. You want to stir them often or they will burn. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant. Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside. Next, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat. Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 - 3 minutes.  Add in your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 - 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry. Once your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat. Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.",
      "Roll your dough out thin but not too thin.  You don't want your dough to not stand up to the filling and the boiling process.",
      "Glass cutting boards are a dough rollers best friend.  I will screw up rolling out dough on my counter top EVERY. TIME. Glass cutting boards are a must have in my house.",
      "Don't forget to spray your ravioli tray and the underside of the press tray with non-stick cooking spray.  Can't emphasize this enough.",
      "You will want to pack in spoonfuls of your delicious pumpkin ravioli filling in your tiny little ravioli wells.  Stop Drop and Roll right here! Don't!!!  Fill your pumpkin ravioli with approximately 2 - 3 teaspoons of filling.  I know it doesn't seem like much but you don't want your ravioli exploding when you cook them.  Those seams need to be sealed up tight and too much filling will push out and you wont get a tight seal."

      "Drain the potatoes and rinse in cold water to stop them from cooking.",
      "Once cooled and drained, gently toss with 1-2 tablespoons olive oil (you need just enough to coat all the potatoes, but you don't want too much or it'll cause a flare up on the grill), and a dash each of salt and pepper, so they are all evenly coated.",
      "Preheat the grill to medium-high. Add the potatoes to a nonstick grill pan, basket or wok, and place on the grill over the flames. Since the potatoes will not be in a single layer, you will want to toss them gently and often so some don't burn while others don't get browned. It will take approximately 20 minutes to cook all of the potatoes thoroughly and for them to be nicely browned. If any get caught in a hot spot and cook too quickly or begin to burn a bit, I just remove them early. If you don't want to mess with a grill basket or pan, you can cut the potatoes the long way and cook them directly on your grill in a single layer, this takes only about 5 minutes per side. (Our grill's grates are a bit too wide and we lose too many this way, so to avoid frustration we go with the pan).",
      "While the potatoes are cooking, in a small bowl add the rice wine vinegar, the remaining Terra Delyssa olive oil, garlic, fresh herbs, salt and pepper, mix well to combine.",
      "Once the potatoes are cooked, place them in a large serving bowl, add the arugula and dressing, gently toss to combine everything. The arugula will begin to wilt a bit with the heat from the potatoes but will keep that nice crunch. Add more salt and pepper to taste. Serve."

You’ll notice a slightly sticky film on the thick tomatillo flesh, but once cooked the skin softens and a tangy, fruity, herbal flavor emerges.",
      "Tomatillos can be diced up and eaten raw like for salsas, but have a more tart flavor. To add to a quick sauce, they can be blanched for about 5 minutes or until tender, then further blended or crushed for salsas, enchilada sauce, soups, or spreads.",
      "To add extra earthy flavors to the tomatillos, you can broil, fire-roast or oven roast the tomatoes like for this chicken tomatillo bowl recipe. I found that this adds additional depth in flavors, and they practically melt in the oven.",

      "▢ 2 jalapeño peppers, stems removed",

      "Place the peeled garlic in foil, lightly drizzle with oil and wrap into a packet that is open from the top, place on the corner of the baking pan. Roast chilies, onion, and garlic for 40 minutes stirring chilies after 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the quinoa and chicken.",
      "Transfer the roasted chilies, onions, garlic and any juice on the pan to a blender or food processor. Add chicken broth, one teaspoon salt, and cilantro to the blender. Pulse on medium speed for about 30 seconds, or until the sauce is smooth.",
      "Add 2 cups of sauce to a large saute pan and set aside. This recipe makes about 5 cups of sauce. You only need 2 cups. Save the extra sauce in the refrigerator for five days, or freeze.",
      "Add 1 cup quinoa to a fine-mesh strainer. Rinse well with running water. Transfer to a pot with lid. Add 2 cups water and ½ teaspoon salt.",
      "Bring to a boil, put a lid on then reduce to a simmer, over medium-low heat. Allow it to cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until water is absorbed, then turn off the heat. Allow it to sit with the lid on for at least 5 minutes. Fluff quinoa with a fork when ready to serve.",
      "Evenly season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts to the pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook another 5 minutes on the other side, or until chicken is no longer pink. Transfer to a clean plate.",
      "Once slightly cooled shred chicken into smaller pieces. Transfer to the saute pan that has 2 cups of tomatillo sauce. Turn heat to medium and warm chicken and sauce until hot. Turn off the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons yogurt. Taste season with more salt and pepper as desired.",
      "Assemble bowls with quinoa, add tomatillo chicken and other desired toppings.",
      "**Additional Topping Suggestions**: Sliced limes, radishes, cilantro, diced onion, tomatoes, black beans, sour cream, and avocado."
